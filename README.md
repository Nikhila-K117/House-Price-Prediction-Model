**Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. The goal was to preprocess real estate data, build predictive models, and evaluate their accuracy for practical decision-making in the housing market.

**Objectives**

â€¢Collect and preprocess the Bangalore house prices dataset (Kaggle).

â€¢Perform feature engineering and dimensionality reduction.

â€¢Build and evaluate regression models with cross-validation.

**Tools & Technologies**

â€¢Python (scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

â€¢Jupyter Notebook

â€¢Kaggle Dataset

**Key Features**

â€¢Preprocessing pipeline with handling of missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

â€¢Model training using Linear Regression with hyperparameter tuning.

â€¢K-fold cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation.
